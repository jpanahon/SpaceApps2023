# SpaceApps 2023 Challenge

<b>What's Up With This Water?</b>
<br>
Have you ever been swimming in a natural body of water and felt curious about the microscopic and larger life all around you, or what else is living in the water? There is a vast amount of life in oceans, rivers, and lakes—most of which cannot be seen with our eyes! Your challenge is to create an app that notifies people of endangered species in the bodies of water around them, explains what they can do to help preserve those species, and informs them how to use the water for recreation in a respectful way.

<b>OBJECTIVES
<br>
Your challenge is to create an app that allows users to check the water quality of their waterways and to learn what endangered species are living in the water as well as how to protect them. Think about how to make your app easy to use; it could be similar to a weather app but even more simplistic. Can your app help users to learn where the water has been before they swim in it? For example, someone swimming in North Carolina could learn that their water mass originated further south and was carried to them by the Gulf Stream.

## Challenge Description

**Challenge Name:** What's Up With This Water?

**Challenge Statement:** Have you ever been swimming in a natural body of water and felt curious about the microscopic and larger life all around you, or what else is living in the water? There is a vast amount of life in oceans, rivers, and lakes—most of which cannot be seen with our eyes! Your challenge is to create an app that notifies people of endangered species in the bodies of water around them, explains what they can do to help preserve those species, and informs them how to use the water for recreation in a respectful way.

## Objectives

The SpaceApps 2023 Challenge "What's Up With This Water?" focuses on creating an app that serves multiple purposes related to water quality, endangered species preservation, and responsible recreation. Here are the main objectives:

1. **Water Quality Monitoring:** Develop an app that allows users to check the water quality of their local waterways. This feature should provide real-time or regularly updated information about the water's safety for various activities.

2. **Endangered Species Awareness:** Create a platform that educates users about the endangered species living in the water bodies around them. This should include information about the species, their habitats, and their conservation status.

3. **Conservation Guidance:** Offer guidance on how users can contribute to the preservation of these endangered species and their habitats. This may involve suggestions for responsible recreational activities near these water bodies.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure that the app is easy to use, possibly with a simple and intuitive design similar to a weather app. Accessibility and user-friendliness are essential.

5. **Geographical Information:** Enable users to learn about the origin of the water they are swimming in. For example, users in North Carolina could discover that their water comes from the Gulf Stream, providing insights into the water's history and potential impacts.

## Technologies Used

To tackle this challenge, a combination of technologies will be employed:

- **Backend Framework (Django):** Django will be used to build the backend infrastructure of the app. It will handle data storage, user authentication, and server-side processing.

- **Frontend Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):** The frontend of the app will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies will ensure an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

- **Web Scraping (JavaScript):** Web scraping techniques using JavaScript will be employed to gather relevant data, such as water quality information and endangered species data, from various sources.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spaceapps-2023-challenge.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies for both the backend (Django) and frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) components of the app.

3. Begin developing the app, adhering to the objectives outlined in this challenge description.
